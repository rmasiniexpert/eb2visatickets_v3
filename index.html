								<h2>What is EB2-NIW visa category?<br /></h2>
								<p>The <strong>EB2 National Interest Waiver (NIW)</strong> visa category is a subcategory of the <strong>EB2 employment-based immigrant</strong> visa classification.</p> 
								<p>It allows certain foreign nationals with exceptional abilities or an advanced degree to apply for a U.S. green card without the need for a job offer or labor certification, which are typically required under the regular EB2 category.</p>
							    <blockquote>The main advantage of the EB2-NIW category is that it allows qualified individuals to bypass the time-consuming and complex process of obtaining a labor certification, which involves proving that there are no qualified U.S. workers available for the position. This makes the EB2-NIW an attractive option for professionals with an advanced degree, or highly skilled professionals, in fields such as entrepreneurship, healthcare, IT, engineering, business, marketing, and law, among others, who can demonstrate that their work will significantly benefit the United States.</blockquote>

						<section class="spotlight">
							<div class="image"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></div><div class="content">
								<h2>To qualify for an NIW, applicants must meet the following criteria:<br /></h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Possess an advanced degree (master's degree or higher) or demonstrate exceptional ability in their field, which involves expertise significantly above that ordinarily encountered in science, arts, or business.</li>
										<li>Show that their proposed work has substantial merit and national importance.</li>
										<li>Prove that they are well-positioned to advance the proposed endeavor.</li>
										<li>Demonstrate that waiving the labor certification and job offer requirements would be in the best interest of the United States.</li>

								<h2>Do I need a lawyer or an immigration consultant to apply for EB2-NIW?<br /></h2>

										<li>Official academic records showing that you have a degree, or similar award from a institution relating to your area of exceptional ability.</li>

										<li>Other comparable evidence of eligibility, such as published articles or research, patents, etc.</li>

								<h2>I meet one of the eligibility criteria for the EB2-NIW category. Is this enough?<br /></h2>
								</p>Meeting one of the eligibility criteria for the EB2-NIW category (either advanced degree or exceptional ability) is just the starting point. In addition to meeting one of these criteria, you must also demonstrate that your work is in the national interest of the United States.
								In essence, the crucial aspect is to demonstrate that the individual’s proposed work in the U.S. holds significant importance and will positively impact the country.</p> 
							    </p>The strongest aspect of our tutorial is the guidance for creating your professional plan and demonstrating its national importance. We have directly worked with over 1000 EB2-NIW cases, especially in devising strategies and developing highly significant national interest professional plans. We have unique expertise in this area, with approval rates above 90%. Our material has been developed over these years of experience and is based on the successful results we have achieved.</p>

							<h2>I meet the criteria but have consulted with more than one attorney who said my case would not qualify for EB2-NIW. Should I give up?<br /></h2>
							</p>No. We were also told by two immigration lawyers that we wouldn’t qualify. So we prepared our case on our own, and within three months, we received approval without any requests for additional evidence from the USCIS.
									We have also worked with hundreds of clients who were turned down by immigration lawyers, claiming their cases were weak due to a lack of exceptional careers, and yet they had their visas approved.</p>
							</p>Some examples include:</p> 
						    </p>• Doctors who practiced in their home countries in their own private practices. Although they were able to demonstrate positive results from their work and an above-average salary for their occupation in their country, they did not develop revolutionary techniques or engage in research.</p>
						    </p>• Financial managers, engineers, or IT professionals with bachelor’s degrees in their field, who have worked for five years or more at one or more companies, and show their career progression, being promoted within the company during those years.</p>
						    </p>• Entrepreneurs who do not have an advanced degree, but have built a successful career through one or more ventures that flourished under their management, and created job opportunities.</p>
						    </p>What these professionals have in common, besides not having exceptional careers, are well-crafted professional plans to be executed in the American market with great potential to positively impact the country. This is where the main focus should be when creating your EB2-NIW application.</p>
